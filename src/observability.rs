//! Observability — structured logs + OTLP metrics + health probes.
//!
//! Mission: every message in or out is auditable. Federation trust
//! requires that any peer can answer "what did you receive, what did
//! you send, what was the verify outcome, when, from whom" — without
//! forensic archaeology.
//! ([`MISSION.md`](../../MISSION.md) §2 `observability/`.)
//!
//! # CIRISEdge#28 v0.19.0 — Observability surface
//!
//! Three load-bearing capabilities ship in this cut:
//!
//! 1. **Tracing spans** — `tracing::instrument` annotations on every
//!    `Edge::send*` / `dispatch_inbound` / transport `send` call site,
//!    with structured fields (`recipient_key_id`, `message_type`,
//!    `delivery_class`, `transport_id`, `signing_key_id`,
//!    `body_sha256_prefix`, `verify_outcome`, `attempt_n`). Consumers
//!    (CIRISLens, CIRISAgent UI) tail the tracing-subscriber-emitted
//!    structured logs and join on the same fields persist's forensic
//!    indices key on.
//!
//! 2. **EdgeMetrics struct** — a snapshot-able counter / gauge bag
//!    living on [`crate::Edge`]. Every send / receive / verify-failure
//!    / transport-bytes path increments the appropriate counter; the
//!    `metrics_snapshot` reads project the live state into a typed
//!    `EdgeMetricsBundle` consumers (PyO3 / UniFFI) can render. The
//!    struct uses `Arc<parking_lot::RwLock<HashMap<...>>>` per the
//!    Cargo.toml note — `parking_lot` is already a v0.11.0 dep
//!    (CIRISEdge#29 `ReachabilityTracker`); `dashmap` is intentionally
//!    NOT pulled (extra license surface + the contention pattern
//!    counter-bumps produce doesn't justify a sharded map).
//!
//! 3. **Pymethod surface** — [`crate::ffi::pyo3::PyEdge::metrics_snapshot`]
//!    returns a Python `dict` of `dict`s; consumers call it repeatedly
//!    for change-detection. The shape is documented on the pymethod.
//!
//! # Structured log fields (per-message)
//!
//! - `signing_key_id` — sender's federation_keys.key_id
//! - `body_sha256_prefix` — joins to persist's forensic indices
//!   (Bridge already trained on this join key during the v0.2.x
//!   debug)
//! - `verify_result` — typed reject code or `verified`
//! - `handler_duration_ms` — handler-time, excludes verify
//! - `transport` — TransportId (http / reticulum-rs / lora / ...)
//!
//! # Counter labels
//!
//! Stable label cardinality:
//!
//! - `envelopes_sent_total[MessageType]` — every successful send/enqueue
//! - `envelopes_received_total[MessageType]` — every verified inbound envelope
//! - `send_failures_total[(TransportId, ErrorClass)]` — typed transport faults
//! - `verify_failures_total[VerifyErrorClass]` — typed verify pipeline rejects
//! - `transport_bytes_in_total[TransportId]` — bytes-counted by the
//!   listener side
//! - `transport_bytes_out_total[TransportId]` — bytes-counted by the
//!   send side
//!
//! Gauges:
//!
//! - `durable_queue_depth[DeliveryClass]` — count of currently-queued
//!   send_durable / send_mandatory / send_federation envelopes
//! - `peer_reachability_ratio[(peer_key_id, medium)]` — rolling
//!   reachability window ratio, mirror of `ReachabilityTracker::snapshot_all`
